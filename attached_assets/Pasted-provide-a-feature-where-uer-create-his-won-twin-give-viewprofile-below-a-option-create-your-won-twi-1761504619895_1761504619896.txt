What to Collect: Real-time feeds or snapshots: KPIs (revenue, margins), CRM/ERP excerpts (e.g., sales metrics), supply chain logs.

What to Collect: Logs of past decisions (e.g., "Why we pivoted Q3 strategy"), board memos, KPI reviews, or a simple form: "Describe 5 key decisions and outcomes." Include timestamps for chronology.
